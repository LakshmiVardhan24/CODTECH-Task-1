Overview of Verilog Logic Gates Project


Objective:

The objective of this project is to have basic digital logic circuits designed, implemented, and simulated using Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and ModelSim simulation software. A comprehensive understanding of digital logic design is aimed to be provided, including the creation of various logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and combinational circuits (such as adders and multiplexers). By the end of the project, the functionality of these circuits is to be verified through simulation and waveform analysis.

Designing Logic Gates:

Various basic logic gates are to be implemented using Verilog:
AND gate
OR gate
NOT gate
NAND gate
NOR gate
XOR gate
XNOR gate

Designing Combinational Circuits:

More complex circuits using basic gates are to be implemented:
Half Adder
Full Adder
2-to-1 Multiplexer
4-to-1 Multiplexer
8-to-1 Multiplexer
16-to-1 Multiplexer

Simulation in ModelSim:

The Verilog code and testbenches are to be compiled.
Simulations using ModelSim are to be run to generate waveforms.
Waveforms are to be analyzed to ensure the circuits perform as expected.

Verification and Debugging:

The correctness of the logic gates and combinational circuits is to be verified by comparing the simulation results with expected results.
Any issues found during simulation are to be debugged.

Project Summary
This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement digital logic circuits using Verilog HDL. The designs are validated through simulation in ModelSim to confirm the correct operation of basic logic gates and more complex combinational circuits. Hands-on experience is gained from writing testbenches and analyzing waveforms, developing a solid foundation in digital design and simulation. The importance of verification and debugging in the design process is highlighted, ensuring that the final circuits perform as intended.
